Write a C program that takes a matrix from the user as input. The dimensions can be (2x2, 4x4,
and 8x8). Make sure that your program tackles any of the dimensions. Your program should
compute the max value from each 2 x 2 submatrix and save it into a new matrix.
For instance, for a 2 x 2 input matrix resultant matrix would have dimensions 1 x 1, for a 4 x 4
input matrix resultant matrix would have dimensions 2 x 2, and for 8 x 8 input matrix resultant
matrix have dimensions 4 x 4. Please refer to the following image to review the working of the
program.
The following matrix has four submatrices of 2 x 2 dimensions, and their maximum values are
saved into a new matrix having dimensions 2 x 2. For example, each submatrix&#39;s subscripts and
max values are provided in the example below.
max(A[0][0],A[0][1],A[1][0],A[1][1]) = 5, max(A[0][2], A[0][3], A[1][2], A[1][3]) = 3

max(A[2][0], A[2][1], A[3][0], A[3][1]) = 7, max(A[2][2], A[2][3], A[3][2], A[3][3]) = 4

A) Your solution must have the required functions for matrix processing. For 2x2, for 4x4 and for 8x8,
equal points are allocated. [15 points]
B) Main function that operates and performs operation on the functions. Use your student id as input
to the functions. E.g., 23k-1234 then your input array should have your id of 1234 repeatedly.
